# ML-Projects

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning projects, showcasing different models, datasets, and techniques. Each project highlights a specific use case or challenge in machine learning. Within each folder, the file that conatisn the code has detailed comments throughout to explan the process. Below is an overview of the projects included in this repository.
